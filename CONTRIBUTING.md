For a few suggestions of what to contribute you can check the 
[issues](https://github.com/kpsychas/word_etymologist/issues) of the project.

I will try to merge any pull request as long as it doesn't break something.
For how to submit a pull request you can check the official 
[documentation](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request)

If you want to contribute more annotated words you can do so by submitting a separate _csv_ file compressed in a _zip_
folder. Format should be the same as the format of _csv_ file I have submitted, unless you want to annotate words in a different way,
e.g. annotate words for whether they have Latin root.
In case you choose to annotate something else explain it in your pull request.
